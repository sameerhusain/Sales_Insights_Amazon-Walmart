Introduction
This repository presents a comparative analysis of e-commerce sales data from Walmart and Amazon, leveraging insights gleaned from two separate Power BI dashboards. The goal is to identify key trends, patterns, and differences in sales performance across both retailers.

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Data Sources:

Dataset Search:

Kaggle: Use Kaggle's search functionality to find datasets related to e-commerce, retail, or sales analysis.
GitHub: Search for repositories or projects that might contain relevant datasets. Look for keywords like "e-commerce," "retail," "sales data," or specific company names.
Data Acquisition:

Kaggle: Download the desired dataset directly from Kaggle in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
GitHub: If the dataset is part of a repository, clone the repository or download the specific data file.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Format Consistency: Ensure that the data from Kaggle or GitHub is in a consistent format with the Walmart and Amazon data. This may involve renaming columns, handling missing values, or converting data types.
Data Merging: Combine the data from the external sources with the Walmart and Amazon data based on common identifiers (e.g., product ID, customer ID).
Enriched Analysis:

Additional Metrics: Use the data from Kaggle or GitHub to calculate additional metrics that were not available in the original datasets.
Comparative Analysis: Compare the trends and patterns observed in the Walmart and Amazon data with those from the external sources to identify discrepancies or confirm findings.
Industry Benchmarks: Use external datasets to benchmark the performance of Walmart and Amazon against industry standards.

Data Cleaning: 
Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in both datasets.
Data Formatting: Ensure data consistency, including date formats, currency units, and product categories.
Data Integration: If necessary, integrate the Walmart and Amazon datasets into a unified format for comparison.
Power BI Implementation
Dashboard Design:

Create two separate Power BI dashboards, one for Walmart data and one for Amazon data.
Ensure consistent visualization styles and color schemes across both dashboards for easy comparison.
